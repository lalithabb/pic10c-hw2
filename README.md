# pic10c-hw2
This is a grade calculator for PIC10B (Intermediate Programming) and PIC10C (Advanced Programming).

Note that for this implementation, you must (1) move the sliders, (2) pick "Schema A" or "Schema B", then (3) push one of the buttons at the top of the GUI (either "PIC10C" or "PIC10B"), in that order, in order for the overall grade to appear at the bottom right of the GUI.
If you wish to view the score for the alternate schema after you have already pushed the PIC10B/PIC10C button, you must change the schema option and press one of the buttons again to view the updated score.

Also note that for the PIC10B grading scheme, the slider labelled "Midterm 2/Final Project" is only used for the Midterm 2 grade. For the PIC10C grading scheme, this slider is only used for the Final Project.
